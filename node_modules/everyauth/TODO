Add in ability to make configurables "required" or "optional", and notify the developer if they forgot to configure something required

What to do when auth fails?


    ea.fb.instructions; // Prints out what needs to be configured

Instructions should include
  - Template of minimum things that must be added
  - Other configuration options
  - Other steps that you can over-ride per route

ea.fb.man should include
  - Description
  - Instructions

Step introspection
    ea.fb.get('authAlias').steps
    ea.fb.get('authAlias').steps.incomplete
      -> {..., missing: ['accepts', 'promises', 'function']}
    ea.fb.get('authAlias').steps.optional
Add introspection method to see all the
- Steps available in a sequence
Add in check for missing step definitions from the set of step declarations
Add introspection to list incompletely defined steps
Add introspection to list invalid steps


Add in ability for step to be optional

With `step` method, use opts (e.g., for ordering information {before: 'otherStepName'})

Add default views and paths for password auth

Add helper to req, so that we can access everyauth local parameter
with nice helpers like getLoginPath and postLoginPath
    everyauth.password
      .viewhelper('getLoginPath')
      .viewhelper('postLoginPath')

Add in sweep before initialization to make sure that all steps
are completely declared (with accepts and promises) and defined (business logic function).
OR Lazy eval version of this check.

Make some steps optional

Add default logoutPath and logout route handler

Twitter module

What about asynchronous request attributes such as req.user

Remove async req decoration stuff.

Make express decoration part of the middleware (Is this possible?)
  - After looking at connect source, I don't think this is possible
